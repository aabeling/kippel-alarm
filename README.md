This is just a small fun cordova app to keep my children from wobbling with their chair.

It is an example of using the cordova-plugin-media and the cordova-plugin-device-motion.

When a threshold value for the accelerometer is exceeded a sound is played.

It was successfully tested with a samsung s4 mini and android 4.4.2.

The device has been attached in a little box of matches under the chair.

The app is built on https://build.phonegap.com/apps/2989296/builds and can be installed from there.
